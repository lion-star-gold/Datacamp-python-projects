##  Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office

This project used data manipulation and data visualisation skills. Packages used were pandas and matplotlib.
Using a dataset originally from Kaggle I extracted information about the popular TV series, The Office (US). A graph, below, was produced, showing episode number, viewership, coloured by rating. Episodes with guest appearances are marked with a star.
